Two roads diverged in a yellow wood	And sorry I could not travel both
And sorry I could not travel both	And be one traveler long I stood
And be one traveler long I stood	And looked down one as far as I could
And looked down one as far as I could	To where it bent in the undergrowth
Then took the other as just as fair	And having perhaps the better claim
And having perhaps the better claim	Because it was grassy and wanted wear
Because it was grassy and wanted wear	Though as for that the passing there
Though as for that the passing there	Had worn them really about the same
And both that morning equally lay	In leaves no step had trodden black
In leaves no step had trodden black	Oh I kept the first for another day
Oh I kept the first for another day	Yet knowing how way leads on to way
Yet knowing how way leads on to way	I doubted if I should ever come back
I shall be telling this with a sigh	Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	Two roads diverged in a wood and I
Two roads diverged in a wood and I	I took the one less traveled by
I took the one less traveled by	And that has made all the difference
Whose woods these are I think I know	His house is in the village though
His house is in the village though	He will not see me stopping here
He will not see me stopping here	To watch his woods fill up with snow
My little horse must think it queer	To stop without a farmhouse near
To stop without a farmhouse near	Between the woods and frozen lake
Between the woods and frozen lake	The darkest evening of the year
He gives his harness bells a shake	To ask if there is some mistake
To ask if there is some mistake	The only other sounds the sweep
The only other sounds the sweep	Of easy wind and downy flake
The woods are lovely dark and deep	But I have promises to keep
But I have promises to keep	And miles to go before I sleep
And miles to go before I sleep	And miles to go before I sleep
Some say the world will end in fire	Some say in ice
Some say in ice	From what Ive tasted of desire
From what Ive tasted of desire	I hold with those who favor fire
I hold with those who favor fire	But if it had to perish twice
But if it had to perish twice	I think I know enough of hate
I think I know enough of hate	To say that for destruction ice
To say that for destruction ice	Is also great
Is also great	And would suffice
Natures first green is gold	Her hardest hue to hold
Her hardest hue to hold	Her early leafs a flower
Her early leafs a flower	But only so an hour
But only so an hour	Then leaf subsides to leaf
Then leaf subsides to leaf	So Eden sank to grief
So Eden sank to grief	So dawn goes down to day
So dawn goes down to day	Nothing gold can stay
I have been one acquainted with the night	I have walked out in rain - and back in rain
I have walked out in rain - and back in rain	I have outwalked the furthest city light
I have looked down the saddest city lane	I have passed by the watchman on his beat
I have passed by the watchman on his beat	And dropped my eyes unwilling to explain
I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet	When far away an interrupted cry
When far away an interrupted cry	Came over houses from another street
But not to call me back or say good-bye	And further still at an unearthly height
And further still at an unearthly height	One luminary clock against the sky
Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right	I have been one acquainted with the night
When I go up through the mowing field	The headless aftermath
The headless aftermath	Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew
Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew	Half closes the garden path
And when I come to the garden ground	The whir of sober birds
The whir of sober birds	Up from the tangle of withered weeds
Up from the tangle of withered weeds	Is sadder than any words
A tree beside the wall stands bare	But a leaf that lingered brown
But a leaf that lingered brown	Disturbed I doubt not by my thought
Disturbed I doubt not by my thought	Comes softly rattling down
I end not far from my going forth	By picking the faded blue
By picking the faded blue	Of the last remaining aster flower
Of the last remaining aster flower	To carry again to you
A voice said Look me in the stars	And tell me truly men of earth
And tell me truly men of earth	If all the soul-and-body scars
If all the soul-and-body scars	Were not too much to pay for birth
To think to know the country and now know	The hillside on the day the sun lets go
The hillside on the day the sun lets go	Ten million silver lizards out of snow
Ten million silver lizards out of snow	As often as Ive seen it done before
As often as Ive seen it done before	I cant pretend to tell the way its done
I cant pretend to tell the way its done	It looks as if some magic of the sun
It looks as if some magic of the sun	Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor
Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor	And the light breaking on them made them run
And the light breaking on them made them run	But if I though to stop the wet stampede
But if I though to stop the wet stampede	And caught one silver lizard by the tail
And caught one silver lizard by the tail	And put my foot on one without avail
And put my foot on one without avail	And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed
And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed	In front of twenty others wriggling speed-
In front of twenty others wriggling speed-	In the confusion of them all aglitter
In the confusion of them all aglitter	And birds that joined in the excited fun
And birds that joined in the excited fun	By doubling and redoubling song and twitter
By doubling and redoubling song and twitter	I have no doubt Id end by holding none
It takes the moon for this The suns a wizard	By all I tell but sos the moon a witch
By all I tell but sos the moon a witch	From the high west she makes a gentle cast
From the high west she makes a gentle cast	And suddenly without a jerk or twitch
And suddenly without a jerk or twitch	She has her speel on every single lizard
She has her speel on every single lizard	I fancied when I looked at six oclock
I fancied when I looked at six oclock	The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast
The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast	The moon was waiting for her chill effect
The moon was waiting for her chill effect	I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock
I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock	In every lifelike posture of the swarm
In every lifelike posture of the swarm	Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect
Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect	Across each other and side by side they lay
Across each other and side by side they lay	The spell that so could hold them as they were
The spell that so could hold them as they were	Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm
Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm	To make a leaf if there had been one stir
To make a leaf if there had been one stir	One lizard at the end of every ray
One lizard at the end of every ray	The thought of my attempting such a stray
ONCE on the kind of day called "weather breeder"	When the heat slowly hazes and the sun
When the heat slowly hazes and the sun	By its own power seems to be undone
By its own power seems to be undone	I was half boring through half climbing through
I was half boring through half climbing through	A swamp of cedar Choked with oil of cedar
A swamp of cedar Choked with oil of cedar	And scurf of plants and weary and over-heated
And scurf of plants and weary and over-heated	And sorry I ever left the road I knew
And sorry I ever left the road I knew	I paused and rested on a sort of hook
I paused and rested on a sort of hook	That had me by the coat as good as seated
That had me by the coat as good as seated	And since there was no other way to look
And since there was no other way to look	Looked up toward heaven and there against the blue
Looked up toward heaven and there against the blue	Stood over me a resurrected tree
Stood over me a resurrected tree	A tree that had been down and raised again—
A tree that had been down and raised again—	A barkless spectre He had halted too
A barkless spectre He had halted too	As if for fear of treading upon me
As if for fear of treading upon me	I saw the strange position of his hands—
I saw the strange position of his hands—	Up at his shoulders dragging yellow strands
Up at his shoulders dragging yellow strands	Of wire with something in it from men to men
Of wire with something in it from men to men	"You here?" I said "Where arent you nowadays
"You here?" I said "Where arent you nowadays	And whats the news you carry—if you know?
And whats the news you carry—if you know?	And tell me where youre off for—Montreal?
And tell me where youre off for—Montreal?	Me? Im not off for anywhere at all
Me? Im not off for anywhere at all	Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways
Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways	Half looking for the orchid Calypso"
Brown lived at such a lofty farm	That everyone for miles could see
That everyone for miles could see	His lantern when he did his chores
His lantern when he did his chores	In winter after half-past three
And many must have seen him make	His wild descent from there one night
His wild descent from there one night	Cross lots cross walls cross everything
Cross lots cross walls cross everything	Describing rings of lantern light
Between the house and barn the gale	Got him by something he had on
Got him by something he had on	And blew him out on the icy crust
And blew him out on the icy crust	That cased the world and he was gone
Walls were all buried trees were few:	He saw no stay unless he stove
He saw no stay unless he stove	A hole in somewhere with his heel
A hole in somewhere with his heel	But though repeatedly he strove
And stamped and said things to himself	And sometimes something seemed to yield
And sometimes something seemed to yield	He gained no foothold but pursued
He gained no foothold but pursued	His journey down from field to field
Sometimes he came with arms outspread	Like wings revolving in the scene
Like wings revolving in the scene	Upon his longer axis and
Upon his longer axis and	With no small dignity of mien
Faster or slower as he chanced	Sitting or standing as he chose
Sitting or standing as he chose	According as he feared to risk
According as he feared to risk	His neck or thought to spare his clothes
He never let the lantern drop	And some exclaimed who saw afar
And some exclaimed who saw afar	The figures he described with it
The figures he described with it	"I wonder what those signals are
Brown makes at such an hour of night	Hes celebrating something strange
Hes celebrating something strange	I wonder if hes sold his farm
I wonder if hes sold his farm	Or been made Master of the Grange"
He reeled he lurched he bobbed he checked	He fell and made the lantern rattle
He fell and made the lantern rattle	(But saved the light from going out)
(But saved the light from going out)	So half-way down he fought the battle
Incredulous of his own bad luck	And then becoming reconciled
And then becoming reconciled	To everything he gave it up
To everything he gave it up	And came down like a coasting child
"Well—I—be—" that was all he said	As standing in the river road
As standing in the river road	He looked back up the slippery slope
He looked back up the slippery slope	(Two miles it was) to his abode
Sometimes as an authority	On motor-cars Im asked if I
On motor-cars Im asked if I	Should say our stock was petered out
Should say our stock was petered out	And this is my sincere reply:
Yankees are what they always were	Dont think Brown ever gave up hope
Dont think Brown ever gave up hope	Of getting home again because
Of getting home again because	He couldnt climb that slippery slope
Or even thought of standing there	Until the January thaw
Until the January thaw	Should take the polish off the crust
Should take the polish off the crust	He bowed with grace to natural law
And then went round it on his feet	After the manner of our stock
After the manner of our stock	Not much concerned for those to whom
Not much concerned for those to whom	At that particular time oclock
It must have looked as if the course	He steered was really straight away
He steered was really straight away	From that which he was headed for—
From that which he was headed for—	Not much concerned for them I say:
No more so than became a man—	And politician at odd seasons
And politician at odd seasons	Ive kept Brown standing in the cold
Ive kept Brown standing in the cold	While I invested him with reasons
But now he snapped his eyes three times	Then shook his lantern saying "Iles
Then shook his lantern saying "Iles	Bout out" and took the long way home
Bout out" and took the long way home	By road a matter of several miles

(And I know of one that didnt thrive)	Where the chimney started above the stove
And I dread the ominous stain of tar	That there always is on the papered walls
That there always is on the papered walls	And the smell of fire drowned in rain
And the smell of fire drowned in rain	That there always is when the chimneys false
A shelfs for a clock or vase or picture	But I dont see why it should have to bear
But I dont see why it should have to bear	A chimney that only would serve to remind me
A chimney that only would serve to remind me	Of castles I used to build in air
I had for my winter evening walk-	No one at all with whom to talk
No one at all with whom to talk	But I had the cottages in a row
But I had the cottages in a row	Up to their shining eyes in snow
And I thought I had the folk within:	I had the sound of a violin
I had the sound of a violin	I had a glimpse through curtain laces
I had a glimpse through curtain laces	Of youthful forms and youthful faces
I had such company outward bound	I went till there were no cottages found
I went till there were no cottages found	I turned and repented but coming back
I turned and repented but coming back	I saw no window but that was black
Over the snow my creaking feet	Disturbed the slumbering village street
Disturbed the slumbering village street	Like profanation by your leave
Like profanation by your leave	At ten oclock of a winter eve
Winds blow the open grassy places bleak	But where this old wall burns a sunny cheek
But where this old wall burns a sunny cheek	They eddy over it too toppling weak
They eddy over it too toppling weak	To blow the earth or anything self-clear
To blow the earth or anything self-clear	Moisture and color and odor thicken here
Moisture and color and odor thicken here	The hours of daylight gather atmosphere
To Ridgely Torrence	On Last Looking into His Hesperides
I often see flowers from a passing car	That are gone before I can tell what they are
I want to get out of the train and go back	To see what they were beside the track
I name all the flowers I am sure they werent	Not fireweed loving where woods have burnt-
Not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth-	Not lupine living on sand and drouth
Was something brushed across my mind	That no one on earth will ever find?
Heaven gives it glimpses only to those	Not in position to look too close
Back out of all this now too much for us	Back in a time made simple by the loss
Back in a time made simple by the loss	Of detail burned dissolved and broken off
Of detail burned dissolved and broken off	Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather
Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather	There is a house that is no more a house

I WALKED down alone Sunday after church	To the place where John has been cutting trees
To the place where John has been cutting trees	To see for myself about the birch
To see for myself about the birch	He said I could have to bush my peas
The sun in the new-cut narrow gap	Was hot enough for the first of May
Was hot enough for the first of May	And stifling hot with the odor of sap
And stifling hot with the odor of sap	From stumps still bleeding their life away
The frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill	Wherever the ground was low and wet
Wherever the ground was low and wet	The minute they heard my step went still
The minute they heard my step went still	To watch me and see what I came to get
Birch boughs enough piled everywhere—	All fresh and sound from the recent axe
All fresh and sound from the recent axe	Time someone came with cart and pair
Time someone came with cart and pair	And got them off the wild flowers backs
They might be good for garden things	To curl a little finger round
To curl a little finger round	The same as you seize cats-cradle strings
The same as you seize cats-cradle strings	And lift themselves up off the ground
Small good to anything growing wild	They were crooking many a trillium
They were crooking many a trillium	That had budded before the boughs were piled
That had budded before the boughs were piled	And since it was coming up had to come
Over back where they speak of life as staying	(You couldnt call it living for it aint)
(You couldnt call it living for it aint)	There was an old old house renewed with paint
There was an old old house renewed with paint	And in it a piano loudly playing
Out in the plowed ground in the cold a digger	Among unearthed potatoes standing still
Among unearthed potatoes standing still	Was counting winter dinners one a hill
Was counting winter dinners one a hill	With half an ear to the pianos vigor
All that piano and new paint back there	Was it some money suddenly come into?
Was it some money suddenly come into?	Or some extravagance young love had been to?
Or some extravagance young love had been to?	Or old love on an impulse not to care-
Not to sink under being man and wife	But get some color and music out of life?
It was long I lay	Awake that night
Awake that night	Wishing that night
Wishing that night	Would name the hour
Would name the hour	And tell me whether
And tell me whether	To call it day
To call it day	(Though not yet light)
(Though not yet light)	And give up sleep
And give up sleep	The snow fell deep
The snow fell deep	With the hiss of spray
With the hiss of spray	Two winds would meet
Two winds would meet	One down one street
One down one street	One down another
One down another	And fight in a smother
And fight in a smother	Of dust and feather
Of dust and feather	I could not say
I could not say	But feared the cold
But feared the cold	Had checked the pace
Had checked the pace	Of the tower clock
Of the tower clock	By tying together
By tying together	Its hands of gold
Its hands of gold	Before its face
Then cane one knock	A note unruffled
A note unruffled	Of earthly weather
